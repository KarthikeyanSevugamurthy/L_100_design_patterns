# Mediator Design Pattern

## Definition
The Mediator Pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.

## Why Use It?
- To avoid tightly coupled object communication
- To centralize complex communication logic

## Where to Use?
- GUI systems (buttons, sliders communicating through a mediator)
- Chat rooms, air traffic control, placement systems

## Pros
- Reduces coupling between components
- Simplifies object communication logic
- Improves maintainability

## Cons
- Can become complex if Mediator grows too large
- Centralized logic may become a bottleneck

## Real-World Examples
- Air traffic control (ATC)
- Chat rooms
- Placement officer coordinating students

## Beginner Example
A placement officer communicating with students through a placement representative (mediator) without direct interaction.
