# 🎯 Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains implementations of common **Design Patterns** in Java. Each pattern is implemented with clarity and proper documentation to help learners and developers understand its usage and structure.

## 📌 What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They represent best practices refined over time by experienced developers.

## 🧩 Pattern Categories

The patterns are grouped into three main categories:

### 1. Creational Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton** – Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method** – Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Abstract Factory** – Creates families of related objects.
- **Builder** – Separates object construction from its representation.
- **Prototype** – Clones existing objects.

### 2. Structural Patterns
These patterns help ensure that components are assembled in a flexible and efficient manner.

- **Adapter** – Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge** – Separates abstraction from implementation.
- **Composite** – Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Decorator** – Adds new behavior to objects dynamically.
- **Facade** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- **Flyweight** – Reduces memory usage by sharing common data.
- **Proxy** – Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
These focus on communication between objects.

- **Chain of Responsibility** – Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
- **Command** – Encapsulates a command request as an object.
- **Interpreter** – Implements a language interpreter.
- **Iterator** – Accesses elements of an object sequentially.
- **Mediator** – Centralizes complex communications.
- **Memento** – Captures and restores an object's internal state.
- **Observer** – Notifies objects when the state changes.
- **State** – Alters behavior when the internal state changes.
- **Strategy** – Defines a family of algorithms.
- **Template Method** – Defines a skeleton of an algorithm.
- **Visitor** – Separates algorithm from object structure.

## 🛠️ How to Use

Each pattern includes:
- A concise **Java implementation**
- A brief **description**
- **Comments** for clarity

Feel free to copy, customize, and integrate any pattern into your own projects or learning exercises.
